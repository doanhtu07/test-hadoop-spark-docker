# Requirements

My Github repo: https://github.com/doanhtu07/test-hadoop-docker

- PySpark/Spark version 3.5.3
- Python version 3.12

# Change input and output paths

- In my code, you can see the global variables at the top to config input and output paths
- You can change them as needed to test my code

# Run my code

- If you have PySpark and Spark on your environment, you can probably run `spark-submit` to run any Python code

- If you are on Databricks, my code would probably work too. But you might have to configure the input files and other package dependencies accordingly
